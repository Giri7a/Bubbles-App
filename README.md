*Module 1*
* Create a Simple Application using HTML5 Canvas Element. Draw 4 circles to the left side of the canvas & fill them with different colors.
* Draw arrows corresponding to each circle to the right side of the canvas.
* All the circles & the arrows should be drawn on a single canvas element.

  *Module 2*
* When you click inside any circle, the arrow to the corresponding circle should start moving towards the circle & hit it.
* Color of the circle should change once the arrow hits them.
* Add a reset button that resets the application to its initial state.
